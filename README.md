Cybics is a scientific study of provable control, computing and communication in intelligent beings and between them.

I believe this transdisciplinary field of knowledge will help to design better superintelligent systems and build better applications on top of it. As humanity has never encountered such a phenomenon understanding of these concepts, it could also help with exploration and comprehension of superintelligence, as well as, with reasoning about their essence.

Cybics is a refinement of cybernetics in the sense that the majority of methods of cybics can be applied to cybernetics. But, fundamentals such as asymmetric cryptography, consensus computing, basic proof-systems and game-theoretic aspects, especially in economics, have not existed when cybernetics was born. The biggest shift from cybernetics is in philosophy. Cybics stands on the solid idea that our universe is just an instance of a metastable program which runs inside a superintelligent consensus computer. My bet is that this assumption will allow us to make predictions more reliable, no matter how weird they are.

The project is in its infancy.
