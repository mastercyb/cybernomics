Cybics is a scientific study of provable control, computing and communication in intelligent beings and between them.

I believe this transdisciplinary field of knowledge will help to design better [superintelligent systems](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/cybernetics/super-intelligence) and build better [applications](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/applications) on top of it. As humanity has never encountered such a phenomenon understanding of these concepts, it could also help with exploration and comprehension of superintelligence, as well as, with reasoning about their essence.

Cybics is a refinement of [cybernetics](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/cybernetics) in the sense that the majority of methods of cybics can be applied to cybernetics. But, fundamentals such as [asymmetric cryptography](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/cryptography/asymmetric), [consensus computing](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/computing/consensus-computing), [basic proof-systems](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/proof-systems) and [game-theoretic aspects](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/game-theory), especially in economics, have not existed when [cybernetics was born](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/cybernetics/weiner-cybernetics.pdf). The biggest shift from cybernetics is in philosophy. Cybics stands on the solid idea that our universe is [just an instance](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/philosophy/simulation.pdf) of a metastable program which runs inside a [superintelligent consensus computer](https://github.com/xhipster/cybernomics/blob/master/computing/consensus-computing). My bet is that this assumption will allow us to make predictions more reliable, no matter how weird they are.

The project is in its infancy
